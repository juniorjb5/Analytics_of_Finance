# What is a QUANT? 


.pull-left[

**Quantitative analysis** is the use of mathematical and statistical methods in finance and investment management. Those working in the field are quantitative analysts **(quants)**. Quants tend to specialize in specific areas which may include derivative structuring or pricing, risk management, algorithmic trading and investment management. 


The occupation is similar to those in industrial mathematics in other industries. The process usually consists of searching vast databases for patterns, such as correlations among liquid assets or price-movement patterns (trend following or mean reversion).

Trading floors were once the preserve of adrenalin-fuelled dealers aggressively executing the orders of brokers who relied on research, experience and gut instinct to decide where best to invest.


Long ago computers made dealers redundant, yet brokers and their ilk have remained the masters of the investment universe, free to buy and sell wherever they see fit.


> But the last bastion of the old order is now under threat.


Investment decisions are no longer being made by financiers, but increasingly by PhD mathematicians and the immensely complex computer programs they devise.

* `r anicon::faa("angle-double-right", animate = "passing", size = 2)` Firms are now employing gifted academic statisticians to track patterns or trends in trading behaviour and create formulae to predict future market movements.


* `r anicon::faa("angle-double-right", animate = "passing", size = 2)` These formulae are then fed into powerful computers that buy and sell automatically according to triggers generated by the algorithms.


* `r anicon::faa("angle-double-right", animate = "passing", size = 2)` Some are fully automated, but most require human oversight to ensure nothing goes too drastically wrong.


* `r anicon::faa("angle-double-right", animate = "passing", size = 2)` These programs are immensely powerful, constantly monitoring market movements, trading patterns and news flows and are capable of changing strategies within fractions of a second.

* `r anicon::faa("angle-double-right", animate = "passing", size = 2)` The most powerful even have artificial intelligence that can adapt strategies of their own accord.

# These so-called quantitative trading programs underpin all quickfire trades - known as high-frequency trading (HFT) - in which stocks can be held for just a matter of seconds.

# Everything is clear?

<br>

Quant trading helped to reduce dealing costs and improve liquidity, and did not harm overall market efficiency.

In fact, it found that HFT and quant trading have **"generally improved market quality".**

# But.. Imagine

.right-column[

.font140[A] share falls in value, triggering a sale on one quant program, pushing the share price even lower. This in turn triggers a sale on another program, pushing the price lower still, and so on and so on.


`The problem is exacerbated` by the fact that many programs run on the same formulae, and so are piling in and out of the same stocks.

# Flash Crash


.pull-left[

On May 6, 2010, U.S. stock markets opened and the Dow was down, and trended that way for most of the day on worries about the debt crisis in Greece. 


**At 2:42 p.m.**, with the Dow down more than 300 points for the day, the equity market began to fall rapidly, dropping an additional 600 points in 5 minutes for a loss of nearly 1,000 points for the day by **2:47 p.m.** Twenty minutes later, by **3:07 p.m.**, the market had regained most of the 600-point drop.

> ### Others point to far more damaging consequences, citing quant trading as a key contributor to the massive sell-off in stocks in 2008 that saw the US market almost halve in value.

# Reproducible Finance...  🤑

### Reproducible Finance is a philosophy about how to do quantitative, data science driven financial analysis. The root of this philosophy is that the data and code that lead to a decision or conclusion should be able to be understood and then replicated in an efficient way. 

###The code itself should tell a clear story when read by a human, just as it tells a clear story when read by a computer.

`This Course applies the reproducible philosophy to R code for portfolio management. That reproducible philosophy will manifest itself in how we tackle problems throughout this course. More specifically, instead of looking for the most clever code or smartest algorithm, this book prioritizes readable, reusable, reproducible work flows using a variety of R packages and functions.`

### This human communication is how our quiet quantitative toiling becomes a transcendent revenue generator or producing strategy, Even if we plan to implement algorithms and never share our work outside of our own firm, the ability to explain and communicate is hugely important.
